// Callback Function Exercise

// 1. Create a function called "calculate" that takes two numbers and pass a callback function as arguments.
// The callback function should perform a mathematical operation (e.g., add, subtract, multiply, divide) on the two numbers.


// 2. Define callback functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


// 3. Test the "calculate" function with different operations and log the results.
