ðŸš€ Objective:

You are tasked with creating a simple webpage that displays information about different types of fruits. Your goal is to select specific elements from the DOM using JavaScript to achieve the following tasks:

- Use getElementById() to:
  - Retrieve the `<h1>` element with the id "main-heading".
- Use querySelector() to:

  - Retrieve the first `<div>` element with the class "fruit".
  - Retrieve the first `<p>` element within a `<div>` with the class "fruit".
  - Retrieve the `<span>` element with the class "fruit-name" within - the first `<div>` with the class "fruit".

- Use querySelectorAll() to:

  - Retrieve all `<div>` elements with the class "fruit".
  - Retrieve all `<p>` elements within `<div>` elements with the class "fruit".
  - Retrieve all `<span>` elements with the class "fruit-name" within `<div>` elements with the class "fruit".

- Bonus:
  - Use querySelectorAll() to select all elements with the class "fruit" and display their total count.
